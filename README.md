## 🔬 Our Project: **Recycle Ray**  
**Recycle Ray** is a smart, portable **X-ray scanning system** designed to detect and reduce harmful residual waste in Belgium’s **blue bag recycling program**.  

### 🏆 **Challenge Statement**
Fost Plus, Belgium’s recycling organization, faces an increasing amount of **residual waste (21%)** in blue bags. Our goal is to **reduce this to 12%** by improving waste sorting without slowing down the collection process.

### 💡 **Solution Overview**
We developed **Recycle Ray**, a **portable X-ray scanner** that:  
✅ **Scans blue bags** for harmful contaminants before reaching sorting centers.  
✅ **Uses geolocation tracking** to log contamination data and enable targeted educational campaigns.  
✅ **Automatically flags contaminated bags** and notifies Fost Plus for intervention.

## ⚡ **Overcoming Key Challenges**
Our solution evolved based on mentor feedback:  

### **🚛 Speed in Garbage Collection**
- Instead of manual scanning, we propose an **automated X-ray system inside garbage trucks** to scan bags as they are loaded.  
- Real-time detection alerts drivers while ensuring a **fast-paced collection process**.  

### **♻️ Handling Contaminated Bags**
- Implementing a **sorting threshold** (e.g., if contamination is below 10%, the bag is accepted).  
- Bags **with high contamination** are flagged and reported via the **Fost Plus geo-database**.  
- Collection workers apply **QR-coded stickers** to inform residents about sorting mistakes.
